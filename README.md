# The Data

The dataset contains the following features:

I have used data from [BuzzFeedNews](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks/master/data/nics-firearm-background-checks.csv), which collects data from a public FBI database.

The totals column in the data represents the net firearms purchased in any given month.
